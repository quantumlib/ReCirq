ReCirq
======

Research using Cirq!

This project contains modules for running quantum computing applications
and experiments through Cirq and Quantum Engine. By way of example, we
also document best practices for setting up robust experimental pipelines.


## Installation and Documentation

Until ReCirq is published to PyPI, please clone this repository and install
from source:

```sh
cd recirq/
pip install .
```

Documentation is available at https://quantumai.google/cirq/experiments.
