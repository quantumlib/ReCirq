"""Utilities to "correct" measured probability distributions using "unfolding."

Based on Nachman et al., "Unfolding quantum computer readout noise"
npj Quantum Information 6 84 (2020) https://doi.org/10.1038/s41534-020-00309-7

This is similar to using "readout matrix inversion" but more numerically stable.
Note it does NOT take into account state preparation error, such as stray |1) population
and pi pulse error.

The readout matrix (R_ij in Nachman et al.) is:
 - Nachman: R_ij = Prob(measured=i | prepared=j) (beginning of "Methods" section)
    â†’ Columns sum to 1

Consistent bitstring ordering and endianness is needed for compatibility
with other libraries.

This is an iterative technique. The key equation is Nachman (5). The number of iterations
to use is not obvious (see Fig. 6), but in practice N=20 iterations works well.

Nachman uses a uniform prior ("guess") probability distribution. This is the most "agnostic"
choice possible. However, starting from the measured distribution works better empircally.

            uniform over all bitstrings (as in Nachman). If False, the initial
