Circuits in this directory were also used for evaluation of
[A Dynamic Look-Ahead Heuristic for the Qubit Mapping Problem of NISQ Computers](https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/abstract/document/8976109).

Most files are named according to what the original circuit was computing and/or
the size of the circuit. None of them are actually quantum chess circuits.

For benchmarking purposes, the size of the circuit is more important than what
the circuit is actually computing.

The sizes of the circuits are as follows:
