Readout Scan Tutorial
=====================

This module is designed as a tutorial to teach the data collection idioms
by way of an example.

 - This experiment is smaller in scope than a real study.
 - `tasks.py` and `run-readout-scan.py` are generated from
   `docs/guide/data_collection.ipynb` with the script
   `devtools/convert-readout-scan-notebook-to-script.py`. 
   We use the notebook to document and
   annotate the process of developing a set of tasks and a driver script.
   Real projects should develop tasks and driver scripts in normal Python
   files.
