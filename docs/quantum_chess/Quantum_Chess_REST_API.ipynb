        "[Quantum Chess](https://quantumchess.net/quantum-chess/) is a variant of chess that gives players access to extra moves which allow them to create superposition. All moves are applied to the game state via unitary evolution, allowing players to experience effects like superposition, entanglement, and interference. This project provides a limited implementation of the full Quantum Chess move set, executed on a set of qubits representing squares. The full Quantum Chess application requires an API for the chess UI to communicate with an external backend for move processing and calculation. In this notebook we will:\n",

We will use the [flask_restful](https://flask-restful.readthedocs.io/en/latest/) framework to create a simple server that implements these enpoints. Flask-restful allows us to encapsulate the functionality we want in classes that inherit from Resource. We will need to install flask-ngrok to give our server an accessible url."
