# Quantum Chess

Quantum phenomena have remained largely inaccessible to the general public. 
This can be attributed to the fact that we do not experience quantum mechanics 
on a tangible level in our daily lives. Games can provide an environment in 
which people can experience the strange behavior of the quantum world in a 
fun and mentally engaging way. Games can also offer an interesting test 
bed for near term quantum devices because they can be tailored to support 
varying amounts of quantum behavior through simple rule changes, 
which can be useful when dealing with limited resources.

and this module
explores the design of a variant of Chess which is built on top of unitary 
dynamics and includes non-trivial quantum effects such as superposition, 
entanglement, and interference.
