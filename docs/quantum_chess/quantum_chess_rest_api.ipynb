    "[Quantum Chess](https://quantumchess.net/quantum-chess/) is a variant of chess that gives players access to extra moves which allow them to create superposition. All moves are applied to the game state via unitary evolution, allowing players to experience effects like superposition, entanglement, and interference. This project provides a limited implementation of the full Quantum Chess move set, executed on a set of qubits representing squares. The full Quantum Chess application requires an API for the chess UI to communicate with an external backend for move processing and calculation. In this notebook we will:\n",
    "* Set up an ascii board representation of a Quantum Chess game running on a Cirq simualtor.\n",
    "* Explore how to interact with the ascii board in interactive mode and by batching moves.\n",
