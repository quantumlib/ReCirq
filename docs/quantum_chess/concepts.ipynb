This tutorial will go over the basics of the rules in order to show how one might implement them in cirq and convert them to use a hardware device.  The full rule set, including rules for more complicated situations (such as castling and en passant) can be found in the [Quantum Chess paper](https://arxiv.org/abs/1906.05836).

    "### Quantum Chess Board Representation\n",
    "\n",
    "In classical chess, each square can be represented by one bit determining whether the square is empty (0) or occupied (1) as well as short integer or 'enum' to distinguish the color and type of piece (e.g. King, Queen, Knight, Bishop, Rook, or Pawn).  \n",
    "\n",
    "Quantum chess will also use the same classical register to store the type of piece, since each square can only have one type of piece in it.  Since the storage of the piece type is entirely classical, we will ignore it throughout the rest of this tutorial and focus on the quantum aspects of the game.\n",
    "\n",
    "Classical chess squares have only two states.  Each square is either occupied or not.  For a quantum version of the game, we will want to allow a continuous spectrum of possibilities of the square's occupancy, as represented by a quantum bit, or qubit.\n",
    "\n",
    "In quantum chess, each square is represented by a single qubit.  If the qubit is in the |1> state, the square is occupied by a piece.  If the qubit is in the |0> state, the square is empty.\n",
    "\n",
    "A board state will be a set of qubits that represent a set of squares.  We will often consider a board that is smaller than the standard 8x8 board of chess so that we can more easily illustrate concepts.\n",
    "\n",
    "For instance, let's consider a 3x3 board.  This board will have 9 squares (a1, a2, a3, b1, b2, b3, c1, c2, c3).  We will represent this as a 'ket' string such as this, with spaces to denote row boundaries for ease of reading:\n",
    "\n",
    "```\n",
    "|a1a2a3 b1b2b3 c1c2c3 >\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "For instance, `|000 000 000>` would represent the empty 3x3 board.  `|010 000 000>` would represent a piece on the 'a2' square.  States can also represent boards with multiple pieces.  `|000 000 110>` would represent a board with pieces on both 'c1' and 'c2'.  Each of these three states is denoted as a **basis state**.\n",
    "\n",
    "A state can also be a super-position of board states.  For instance, \n",
    "$\\frac{1}{\\sqrt{2}}$ `( |100 000 000> + |010 000 000> )` represents a piece being in superposition of being on 'a1' and 'a2'.  This tutorial will often drop the normalization factor such as $\\frac{1}{\\sqrt{2}}$ when it doesn't matter to the explanation.\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "#### Additional qubits\n",
    "\n",
    "Note that there are some exceptions that require extra qubits beyond the requirement of one qubit per square.  These extra qubits (often called \"ancilla\" qubits) are needed to store captured pieces and to store extra information, such as whether a path is blocked by a piece.  We will ignore these extra ancilla qubits for now in order to keep the tutorial focused."

    "### Quantum Chess Moves\n",
    "\n",
    "We will be studying a subset of possible quantum chess moves in this tutorial.\n",
    "\n",
    "We will primarily consider the following moves to implement on the hardware:\n",
    "\n",
    "#### Basic jump move\n",
    "\n",
    "This maneuver will be applied when we wish to apply a standard chess move to a piece.  This will be how kings and knights move.  In classical chess, we would remove the piece from its original square and then add it to the target square we are moving it to.\n",
    "\n",
    "For quantum chess, we would like to do an analogous operation that preserves any quantum information.  In order to do this, we will swap the two squares.  We will do this by performing an **iSWAP** gate between the two qubits that represent those squares.  Note that this operation will also add a phase of *i* onto the qubits in addition to swapping them, adding a uniquely quantum aspect to the move.\n",
    "\n",
    "![Standard Move](./images/qc_standard_move.png)\n",
    "\n",
    "For example, if we attempt to move a King piece from the 'a1' square to the 'b1' square, we will perform a iSWAP gate between the qubits that represent the 'a1' and 'b1' squares.\n",
    "\n",
    "#### Split move\n",
    "\n",
    "The split move is unique to quantum chess.  This move will be analogous to moving a piece to two different target squares simultaneously.  If we were to then measure the quantum board, we should get a 50% probability of seeing the piece in either of the two target squares.\n",
    "\n",
    "This will be accomplished by doing a $\\sqrt{\\text{iSWAP}}$ between the source and the first target.  This will create an equal superposition between the source and the first target square.  We would finish the move by performing a iSWAP between the source square and second target square.  This will create an equal superposition between the two target squares.\n",
    "\n",
    "![Split Move](./images/qc_split_move1.png)\n",
    "\n",
    "For example, suppose that that we split move a King on 'a1' to the squares 'b1' and 'b2'.  To do this, we would do a $\\sqrt{\\text{iSWAP}}$ between the qubits representing 'a1' and 'b1' followed by an **iSWAP** on the 'a1' and 'b2' qubits.  A short-hand notation for this move is *Ks1^t1t2* for source square s1 and split targets t1 and t2.  This example would be noted as *Ka1^b1b2*.\n",
    "\n",
    "#### Slide move\n",
    "\n",
    "A slide move is how we will move bishops, queens, and rooks.  These pieces move along a straight path, but cannot pass through intervening pieces.  However, in quantum chess, there may be a piece that is in superposition and may or may not block the path of this move.\n",
    "\n",
    "In order to accomplish this move without measuring (and thereby destroying the quantum nature of the game), we will need to **entangle** the two pieces.  The way we will do this is called a \"controlled\" gate.  A [controlled gate](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Quantum_logic_gate#Controlled_(cX_cY_cZ)_gates) is a gate that is only performed if the control qubit(s) are in the `|1>` state.\n",
    "\n",
    "This tutorial will only consider paths that are blocked by one possible piece.  In this case, we will perform a **controlled-iSWAP** between the source square and target square controlled by the square that is potentially blocking the path.\n",
    "\n",
    "![Slide Move](./images/qc_slide_move.png)\n",
    "\n",
    "For example, suppose we are moving a rook from 'a1' to 'c1', but there is a split knight on 'b1'.  To perform this slide move, we would do an iSWAP between the qubits that represent 'a1' and 'c1' controlled by the 'b1' qubit.  This operation can result in two potential states.  Either the rook is on 'c1' and the knight is not on 'b1' (path was open) or, alternatively, the rook is on 'a1' and the knight is on 'b1' (path was blocked).  The quantum board state cannot be described without mentioning the relationship between the 'b1' and 'a1'/'c1' squares, so we can say that those squares are *entangled*.\n",
    "\n",
    "#### Exclusion move\n",
    "\n",
    "It was mentioned earlier that each square must have only one type of piece.  For instance, a square cannot have 0.1 of a knight and 0.5 of a rook.  This would not be allowed.  This is called the 'no double occupancy' rule.  We will use measurement as a tool to prevent this situation and disambiguate the type of the piece.\n",
    "\n",
    "This can happen in a variety of circumstances, but we will only consider the case where a piece attempts to make a legal, standard move into a square with a piece of its own color.  \n",
    "\n",
    "![Exclusion Move](./images/qc_exclusion_move.png)\n",
    "\n",
    "For instance, suppose we attempt to move a king from 'a1' to 'a2' and there is a split knight on the 'a2' square.  We would then need to measure the 'a2' square.  If the measurement is 1, then the knight occupies the square and the king cannot move.  If the measurement is 0, the knight is not on the square and the king moves successfully.  In this case, we have a classical 'mixture' of states.  Half the time, we would get the king on 'a1' and the knight on 'a2'.  The other half of the time, the king would be on 'a2'.  However, since we have measured and projected the state to one of these possibilities, there would be no superposition or entanglement, and this part of the board would be in a classical state (definitively in either one configuration or the other).\n",
    "\n",
    "#### Other moves\n",
    "\n",
    "These four type of moves are enough to illustrate the complexities of translating an abstract algorithm (quantum chess) onto a concrete hardware implementation.  However, those who are curious can see the full rule set in the [Quantum Chess](https://arxiv.org/abs/1906.05836) paper on arXiv, including for capture, en passant, and castling.\n",
    "\n",
    "**Exercise for the reader**: This describes one possible rule set for translating the game of chess into the quantum world.  How might the game change if you use SWAP gates instead of iSWAP gates?  Can you devise ways to tell the two games apart?  Can you think of other methods to create split moves or other interesting alternatives?\n"

    "## Quantum Chess Simulation\n",
    "\n",
    "Now that we have introduced the moves of quantum chess and their corresponding circuits, let's look at how we might actually perform our quantum chess moves and circuits in hardware.  We will first start by learning how to implement them in cirq and how to execute them using cirq's built-in simulator.\n",
    "\n",
    "If we consider that a chess board has 64 squares, then the simulation will need 64 qubits.  Since any combination of these bits is a valid basis state of the system, this means that, in order to do a complete simulation, we will need to keep track of $2^{64}$ states, which is something around 10 quintillion states.  This is obviously infeasible.\n",
    "\n",
    "However, most of these positions are unreachable by any common set of moves.  For most reasonable positions, there is a much smaller amount of superposition, so we do not need to keep track of all of those states, since the probability of those states is zero and will remain zero after we make our moves.\n",
    "\n",
    "For example, the initial position is a classical position, so we only need to keep track of one possible state, where the initial squares are in the |1> state and the empty squares are in the |0> state.  After we make a split move, now we have to keep track of two states.  Each successive move on the board will need to tabulate its effect on both of these possible states.\n",
    "\n",
    "**Example**:\n",
    "\n",
    "Let's consider a 3x3 board as defined above with one King piece that starts in the square 'a1'.  This initial state is:\n",
    "\n",
    "```\n",
    "|100 000 000>\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "Note that, since there are 9 squares, there are $2^9=512$ possible basis states and a position on this board could be a superposition of any of the 512 basis states.  \n",
    "\n",
    "For instance, let's suppose that we now perform a split move from 'a1' to 'b1' and 'b2'.  Then the state will be (ignoring the factor of $i/{\\sqrt{2}}$): \n",
    "\n",
    "```\n",
    "|000 010 000> + |000 100 000>\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "![Quantum king moves](./images/qc_qking_moves.png)\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "Now, suppose that we make two additional moves.  First, we will split the \"half-king\" on 'b1' to 'c1' and 'c2'.  Next, we will split the 'half king' on 'b2' to 'b3' and 'c3'.\n",
    "\n",
    "So, despite that we have made three split moves that involve almost all of the squares on the board, we still only have to worry about 4 of the 512 states on the board.  The state is now (ignoring the constant factor):\n",
    "\n",
    "```\n",
    "|000 000 100> + |000 000 010> + |000 001 000> + |000 000 001>\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "Of course, if we continue splitting moves, we will eventually get to a large number of potential states.  However, we will never need to consider all 512 states in this example, since some states can never be reached by a sequence of moves.  For instance, the state `|110 000 000>` represents a king on a1 *and* a king on b1.  There's no way where we can start the board with one king on the board and suddenly wind up with two kings (unless we have noise, more on that later).\n",
    "\n",
    "**Exercise to the reader**: How many basis states are possible to include in a superposition if we allow the player to make as many normal/split moves as they want? How many superpositions are possible?\n",
    "\n",
    "**Summary**\n",
    "\n",
    "Since the space of possible quantum chess positions is *much* smaller than the space of possible quantum states, it is very tractable to simulate quantum chess if we have a custom simulator tuned to consider only relevant states.\n"

This may feel unusual to some, but it can be compared to \"textbook\" circuits that have lines for abstract qubits that are unnamed or have simple symbolic names.  We will first try to define our algorithm in the abstract case, then move towards a physical representation at the end of this colab."

For instance, the different squares could have picked up phases of $i$, and we would not be able to tell by just looking at the measurement results.  We may be destroying this information by simplifying the circuit.\n",

    "## Post-selection\n",
    "\n",
    "One way of resolving this is to use the method of \"post-selection\".  Both simulators and real hardware have the ability to repeat an experiment many times.  We can use this ability to pick the samples that match our expectations of the results.  \n",
    "\n",
    "In the example above, we have two independent possibilities for the measurement of the king.  Half of results will have 'm0' (the king was on the square preventing the queen move) and half will have 'm1' result (the king was not there and the queen move was possible).  In our game, we know that 'm0' is what happened, so we can run the simulation multiple times and only take the results that are consistent with 'm0'.\n",
    "\n",
    "This procedure is only needed since we need to run the simulation from the beginning of the board each time.  If we could \"save\" the state vector from the last move, we would not need to do this.  We could just apply the next move on the last state vector.  While this is possible in a classical simulator, quantum states in a real device only stay coherent for mere microseconds and won't wait around while we ponder our next quantum chess move.\n",
    "\n",
    "A quantum algorithm that uses results of measurements to affect later steps is called a \"feed-forward\".  We are going to use post-selection to transform the current feed-forward algorithm of quantum chess into an algorithm that has terminal measurements only.\n",
    "\n",
    "We will transform our first algorithm from:\n",
    "\n",
    "*  Make some non-measurement moves.\n",
    "*  Make a move that requires measurement and gets an outcome of 'm0'\n",
    "*  Make a second set of non-measurement moves based on this outcome.\n",
    "\n",
    "Into the following new algorithm:\n",
    "\n",
    "*  Make some non-measurement moves.\n",
    "*  Make the exclusion move but don't measure yet.\n",
    "*  Make the second set of moves.\n",
    "*  Measure the relevant qubits.  Discard results that do not match our expected result of 'm0'\n",
    "\n",
    "Note that we have to be careful when we do this.  First, we have to track the qubits to perform the correct measurement.  In our example above, the queen moved to the 'b2' square, regardless of whether the king was there.  Executing that move swapped the qubits of 'b2' and 'a3'.  So, when we measure the king's position at the end of the circuit, we need to measure its new position within the 'a3' qubit.\n",
    "\n",
    "Second, we need to ensure that the two outcomes are truly independent.  If further moves begin interacting with our 'a3' square that holds the position of the king, then we may get incorrect results.  To do this correctly, we may want to swap the king's state into an ancillary qubit so that it doesn't interact with further moves.  This is left as an exercise to the reader.\n",

    "\n",
    "*   **T1 Decay / relaxation**:  Qubits in the excited state $\\vert 1\\rangle$ could lose energy and fall into the ground state $\\vert 0\\rangle$.  This is typically qualified by a metric called T1 that specifies the rate of exponential decay (similar to a \"half-life\" of radioactive decay).\n",
    "*   **Dephasing error**:  Qubits could be \"spinning\" in relation to each other.  For instance, a qubit in $\\frac{1}{\\sqrt{2}} (\\vert0\\rangle + \\vert 1\\rangle)$ could become $\\frac{1}{\\sqrt{2}} (\\vert0\\rangle + i\\vert 1\\rangle)$.  This is sometimes simplified to a measure called T2 or T2*.  However, since dephasing errors can \"spin\" at many different rates and directions, a full noise spectrum is needed to fully characterize these types of errors.\n",
    "*   **Readout/measurement error**: If we accidentally detect a $\\vert 0\\rangle$ as a $\\vert 1\\rangle$ or vice versa when performing a measurement, this is often classified as a readout error. \n",
    "*   **Control/Coherent error**: The device can drift out of calibration or can be too difficult to control effectively.  If every time that we do a $\\text{iSWAP}$ gate, we consistently do a $\\text{iSWAP}^{0.98}$, this is a coherent error.\n",
