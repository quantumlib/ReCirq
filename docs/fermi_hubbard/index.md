# Simulation of spin and charge dynamics in the Fermi-Hubbard model

This module contains an implementation of code to simulate the dynamics of the 
one-dimensional Fermi-Hubbard model on Google's Quantum Computing Service

## Overview

The examples allow to analyze and reproduce the results published 
in [arXiv:2010.07965](https://arxiv.org/abs/2010.07965) **[quant-ph]**:

* The [experiment_example.ipynb](experiment_example.ipynb)
  notebook guides on how the code is structured, how to simulate the Fermi-Hubbard model
  and execute the experiment using Google's Quantum Computing Service.
* The [publication_results.ipynb](publication_results.ipynb) notebook guides through the
  analysis of results from the data set which was released together with the publication.
  The data set consists of four zip files and can be accessed at 
  [https://doi.org/10.5061/dryad.crjdfn32v](https://doi.org/10.5061/dryad.crjdfn32v).
  The files need to be downloaded and extracted into the
  `docs/fermi_hubbard/fermi_hubbard_data/` directory.
