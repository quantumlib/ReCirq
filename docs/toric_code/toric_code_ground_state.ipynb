The general idea is to start out with $|0\\rangle^{\\otimes 22}$, so all $\\langle A_s \\rangle = +1$. We then apply projection operators $\\mathbb{I} + B_p$ which project the state into a $+1$ eigenstate of $B_p$, after which all the local parities are $+1$:\n",

Starting from $|0\\rangle^{\\otimes n}$, we perform a Hadamard on each team captain, and then each team captain is responsible for performing a CNOT to each of its team mates. We have to be careful with the ordering to keep things efficient and avoid the captains stepping on each other's toes. This is easier to visualize for a smaller system, for example the 12-qubit version in Figure S2, reproduced below. Note the superposition of $2^4$ states, as there are four plaquettes $B_p$.\n",
