# Toric Code

The toric code is an "instant classic" model of interacting qubits on a
2D lattice first proposed by Alexei Kitaev in 1997
(

).

In
[K. J. Satzinger et al., Science 374 6572, 1237-1241 (2021)](https://doi.org/10.1126/science.abi8378)
, we create toric code eigenstates on our quantum processor
and explore their essential topological properties: long-range entanglement,
anyonic excitations, and locally-indistinguishable degenerate states used as
logical qubits. In the following example, we focus on understanding and
creating a toric code ground state.
