Dividing your pipeline into tasks can be more of an art than a science. However, some rules of thumb can be observed:\n",
        "\n",
        " 1. A task should be at least 30 seconds worth of work but less than ten minutes worth of work. Finer division of tasks can make your pipelines more composable, more resistant to failure, easier to restart from failure, and easier to parallelize. Coarser division of tasks can amortize the cost of input and ouput data serialization and deserialization.\n",
        " \n",
        " 2. A task should be completely determined by a small-to-medium collection of primitive data type parameters. In fact, these parameters will represent instances of tasks and will act as \"keys\" in a database or on the filesystem.\n",

We use the utility annotation `@json_serializable_dataclass`, which wraps the vanilla `@dataclass` annotation, except it permits saving and loading instances of `ReadoutScanTask` using Cirq's JSON serialization facilities. We give it an appropriate namespace to distinguish between top-level `cirq` objects.\n",
        "\n",
        "2. Data members are all primitive or near-primitive data types: `str`, `int`, `GridQubit`. This sets us up well to use `ReadoutScanTask` in a variety of contexts where it may be tricky to use too-abstract data types. First, these simple members allow us to map from a task object to a unique `/`-delimited string appropriate for use as a filename or a unique key. Second, these parameters are immediately suitable to serve as columns in a `pd.DataFrame` or a database table. \n",
        "\n",
        "3. There is a property named `fn` which provides a mapping from `ReadoutScanTask` instances to strings suitable for use as filenames. In fact, we will use this to save per-task data. Note that every dataclass member variable is used in the construction of `fn`. We also define some utility methods to make more human-readable strings. There must be a 1:1 mapping from task attributes to filenames. In general it is easy to go from a Task object to a filename. It should be possible to go the other way, although filenames prioritize readability over parsability; so in general this relationship won’t be used.\n",
        "\n",
        "4. We begin with a `dataset_id` field. Remember, instances of `ReadoutScanTask` must completely capture a task. We may want to run the same qubit for the same number of shots on the same device on two different days, so we include `dataset_id` to capture the notion of time and/or the state of the universe for tasks. Each family of tasks should include `dataset_id` as its first parameter."

If it does and the output is completely determined by its inputs, then we can deduce that the task is already done. This can save time for expensive classical pre-computations or it can be used to re-start a collection of tasks where only some of them had completed.\n",
