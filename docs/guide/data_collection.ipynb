    "\n",
    "We organize our experiments around the concept of \"tasks\". A task is a unit of work which consists of loading in input data, doing data processing or data collection, and saving results. Dividing your pipeline into tasks can be more of an art than a science. However, some rules of thumb can be observed:\n",
    "\n",
    " 1. A task should be at least 30 seconds worth of work but less than ten minutes worth of work. Finer division of tasks can make your pipelines more composable, more resistant to failure, easier to restart from failure, and easier to parallelize. Coarser division of tasks can amortize the cost of input and output data serialization and deserialization.\n",
    " \n",
    " 2. A task should be completely determined by a small-to-medium collection of primitive data type parameters. In fact, these parameters will represent instances of tasks and will act as \"keys\" in a database or on the filesystem.\n",
    "\n",
    "Practically, a task consists of a `TasknameTask` (use your own name!) dataclass and a function which takes an instance of such a class as its argument, does the requisite data processing, and saves its results. Here, we define the `ReadoutScanTask` class with members that tell us exactly what data we want to collect."

    "There are some things worth noting with this TasknameTask class.\n",
    "\n",
    "1. We use the utility annotation `@json_serializable_dataclass`, which wraps the vanilla `@dataclass` annotation, except it permits saving and loading instances of `ReadoutScanTask` using Cirq's JSON serialization facilities. We give it an appropriate namespace to distinguish between top-level `cirq` objects.\n",
    "\n",
    "2. Data members are all primitive or near-primitive data types: `str`, `int`, `GridQubit`. This sets us up well to use `ReadoutScanTask` in a variety of contexts where it may be tricky to use too-abstract data types. First, these simple members allow us to map from a task object to a unique `/`-delimited string appropriate for use as a filename or a unique key. Second, these parameters are immediately suitable to serve as columns in a `pd.DataFrame` or a database table. \n",
    "\n",
    "3. There is a property named `fn` which provides a mapping from `ReadoutScanTask` instances to strings suitable for use as filenames. In fact, we will use this to save per-task data. Note that every dataclass member variable is used in the construction of `fn`. We also define some utility methods to make more human-readable strings. There must be a 1:1 mapping from task attributes to filenames. In general it is easy to go from a Task object to a filename. It should be possible to go the other way, although filenames prioritize readability over parsability; so in general this relationship wonâ€™t be used.\n",
    "\n",
    "4. We begin with a `dataset_id` field. Remember, instances of `ReadoutScanTask` must completely capture a task. We may want to run the same qubit for the same number of shots on the same device on two different days, so we include `dataset_id` to capture the notion of time and/or the state of the universe for tasks. Each family of tasks should include `dataset_id` as its first parameter."

    "\n",
    "Each task is comprised not only of the Task object, but also a function that executes the task. For example, here we define the process by which we collect data.\n",
    "\n",
    " - There should only be one required argument: `task` whose type is the class defined to completely specify the parameters of a task. Why define a separate class instead of just using normal function arguments?\n",
    "  - Remember this class has a `fn` property that gives a unique string for parameters. If there were more arguments to this function, there would be inputs not specified in `fn` and the data output path could be ambiguous.\n",
    "  - By putting the arguments in a class, they can easily be serialized as metadata alongside the output of the task.\n",
    " - The behavior of the function must be completely determined by its inputs.\n",
    "  - This is why we put a `dataset_id` field in each task that's usually something resembling a timestamp. It captures the 'state of the world' as an input.\n",
    "  - It's recommended that you add a check to the beginning of each task function to check if the output file already exists. If it does and the output is completely determined by its inputs, then we can deduce that the task is already done. This can save time for expensive classical pre-computations or it can be used to re-start a collection of tasks where only some of them had completed.\n",
    " - In general, you have freedom to implement your own logic in these functions, especially between the beginning (which is code for loading in input data) and the end (which is always a call to `recirq.save()`). Don't go crazy. If there's too much logic in your task execution function, consider factoring out useful functionality into the main library."
