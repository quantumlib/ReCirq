    "This notebook acts as a script to run the experiments and save the data associated with Figures 2d through 3d in the paper: Observation of Time-Crystalline Eigenstate Order on a Quantum Processor ([Nature](https://www.nature.com/articles/s41586-021-04257-w)). \n",

    "Each of the five experiments are built using `recirq.time_crystals.dtctasks.CompareDTCTask`, which defines the experiment parameters that are to be compared. `CompareDTCTask.dtctasks()` then creates `recirq.time_crystals.dtctasks.DTCTask`s with all of the requisite parameters for an instance of the experiment. \n",
    "\n",
    "A `DTCTask` has the following attributes and default values: \n",
    "- `qubits`: Sequence of qubits connected in a chain. Defaults to a line of $16$ connected `cirq.GridQubits`. \n",
    "- `disorder_instances`: Number of disorder instances to simulate and average resulting polarizations over. Defaults to $36$.\n",
    "- `g`: Control parameter which influences how well the system is able to maintain time-crystalline behavior. Used in `cirq.PhasedXZGate`s in the circuit. Defaults to $0.94$.\n",
    "- `initial_state` or `initial_states`: Only one should be supplied. Defines the input state of the system and is implemented with `cirq.Y` gates in the circuit. If `initial_state` is supplied, it will be repeated and used for every disorder instance. Defaults to a different random bit string for each disorder instance.\n",
    "- `local_fields`: Random potentials critical to enable many-body local behavior. Used in `cirq.PhasedXZGate`s in the circuit. Defaults to uniformly selected float values between $-1.0$ and $1.0$.\n",
    "- `thetas`, `zetas` and `chis`: Parameters used in the FSim gates in the circuit. Defaults to zero in all cases.\n",
    "- `phis`: Parameter used in the FSim gates in the circuit. Affects the stability of the time-crystalline behavior. Defaults to uniformly selected float values between $-1.5*\\pi$ and $-0.5*\\pi$. \n",
    "- `gammas`: Parameter used in the FSim gates in the circuit. `Gammas` and `phis` are interdependent such that they satisfy $gammas = -2*phis$; One is set according to this equation if the other is supplied, otherwise use the default `phis` and calculate `gammas` from that.\n",
    "\n",
    "`CompareDTCTask.dtctasks()` takes the product over the values of the `options_dict` supplied to the `CompareDTCTask` object, and passes those values as parameters to the `__init__()` function for `DTCTask`. Any parameter not supplied takes it's default value, meaning only the different parameter options that are to be compared need to be supplied to `CompareDTCTask`'s `options_dict`. This also means that supplying one parameter option for a parameter fixes that parameter option across all cases, instead of using the defaults, which may randomly generate values for each different `DTCTask`.
