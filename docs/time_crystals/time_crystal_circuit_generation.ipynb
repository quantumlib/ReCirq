    "# Time Crystal Circuit Generation\n",
    "This notebook covers how Many Body Local Discrete Time Crystal circuit lists are created, from the paper: Observation of Time-Crystalline Eigenstate Order on a Quantum Processor ([Nature](https://www.nature.com/articles/s41586-021-04257-w)). \n",
    "\n",
    "Quantum computers and gate-based quantum circuits turn out to be well suited for crafting systems that exhibit time-crystalline behavior. Behavior is crystalline with respect to time if it has some consistent and stable pattern over time. This system's pattern must be resilient against perturbation in the same way that a space-crystalline object, like a diamond, maintains its structure (is still a diamond) if moved or heated. \n",
    "\n",
    "The quantum computer supplies a system of many qubits, locally connected to each other in a chain. A many-body local (MBL) system like this is critical for the existence of a time crystal. Without an MBL system, it is expected that the system's state would decay into a maximum entropy state that is incompatible with the goal of stable and consistent time structure. \n",
    "\n",
    "The time-crystalline behavior that the discrete time crystal (DTC) circuits demonstrate is perhaps the simplest kind of time-structured behavior, oscillation. Each circuit is built with some number of identical $U$-cycles. Time is represented by a circuit list where each circuit is ordered with increasingly many $U$-cycles; each cycle is considered a discrete time step. The eventual effect of these $U$-cycles is consistent oscillations of each qubits' polarizations. The experiments performed demonstrate that this time-crystalline oscillation behavior is stable in spite of different initial states and introduced random potentials. "

The qubits are connected in a chain, and each qubit pair connection in that chain is coupled with a `cirq.PhasedFSimGate` that uses the parameters `[theta, zetas, chi, gamma, phi]`. To keep gates from overlapping on the same qubit, this chain of gates is split into the second and third moments, such that no two gates share a qubit within each moment. \n",
