# Information scrambling in computationally complex quantum circuits

Interaction in quantum systems can spread initially localized quantum information 
into the many degrees of freedom of the entire system. Understanding this process, 
known as **quantum scrambling**, is the key to resolving various conundrums in physics. 

In [arXiv:2101.08870](https://arxiv.org/abs/2101.08870), we experimentally investigated
the dynamics of quantum scrambling on a 53-qubit quantum processor. By measuring 
the time-dependent evolution and fluctuation of out-of-time-order correlators (OTOCs),
signatures of both mechanisms associated with quantum scrambling, *operator spreading* 
and *operator entanglement*, were experimentally observed.

This documentation shows how to build quantum circuits used in this experiment and run
them to reproduce results in this publication.
